The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. It generates an initial configuration randomly, then you observe how it evolves.

To do:

- [x] generate initial state
- [x] display states
  - [x] 1D
  - [x] 2D
  - [ ] any dimension number
- [ ] use webworkers
- [ ] genetic algorithms
  - [ ] selection 
  - [ ] crossover 
  - [ ] mutation
- [ ] write tests for known cases
